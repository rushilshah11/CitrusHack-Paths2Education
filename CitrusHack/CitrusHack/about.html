            We are trying to inform students about other post-high school alternatives. By sharing the stories of those with different paths to success, we aim to help high school students understand that they have options, that it’s okay for them to pursue something other than a traditional 4-year route. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The average college student goes 100k into debt. From a young age, high school students are told to apply to college in order to succeed. It’s ingrained into our minds that college = success.
Students rarely consider other options besides college. The expectation of going to a 4-year college/university has been heavily embedded in society.
