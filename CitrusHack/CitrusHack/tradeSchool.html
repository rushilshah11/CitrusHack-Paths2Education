          In many occupations with apprenticeships, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects employment to grow at least as fast as the average for all occupations-if not faster from 2016-26. Nationwide, there were over 633,000 apprentices obtaining the skills they need to succeed while earning the wages they need to build financial security. In FY 2019 alone, more than 81,000 apprentices graduated from the apprenticeship system, and more than 252,000 new individuals nationwide entered the apprenticeship system. According to the NPR, states are now trying to reverse the notion that four year colleges are the only path to success. "The U.S Department of Education reports that there will be 68 percent more job openings in the next five years than there are people training to fill them.. while the proportion of high school students who earned three or more credits in occupational education - typically an indication that they're interested in careers or skilled trades - has fallen from 1 in 4 in 1990 to 1 in 5 now."
