            "For students who are in good physical condition and are willing to enlist, the military can offer a lot of benefits. These include a stable paycheck and free food and housing early in one’s career. After retirement, you can expect a substantial pension and VA loans that promote the ability to buy a house without a down payment. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Other benefits include health insurance for the enlisted person and their family, 30 days of paid leave per year and discounted vacation resorts worldwide, and substantial education benefits if you do choose to attend college later via the GI Bill, college reimbursement plans, and others.
            <br>
            <br>
            Of course, joining the military isn’t a decision to be taken lightly and there are some significant challenges you should consider before enlisting. First, the physical requirements are difficult and you’ll need to commit to keeping yourself in top physical shape. In addition, the command structure forces you to follow orders without question and includes laws governing your personal life, including things like deciding when you can get married, whether you can ride a motorcycle, and how you practice personal grooming.  Finally, one cannot quit the military, so enlisting is something you need to take very, very seriously. You must either serve out your contract or face jail time. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition, it should go without saying that there are significant concerns related to serving in the military. You could be stationed far away from friends and family for extended times, and you could even face combat in a war zone. You need to carefully weigh the pros and cons as they relate to you personally before enlisting in the military."<br> - Kate Sundquist, "Does Every Student Need College?
