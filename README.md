# CitrusHack-Paths2Education
Website created at a UCR hackathon spreading awareness on educational alternatives and opportunities


Hi! Our names are Rushil Shah, Gavin Meregillano, Andrew Pham, and Ahaan Rajnekar. We all are freshman attending UC Riverside studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, respectively. 

We built a website that provides students with opportunties and scholarships. The website also aims to spread awareness on alternatives to college, which includes trade schools, entreprenuership, military, community college, and a gap year. Our project falls under the diversity and inclusion track for CitrusHack. 

Feel free to explore our website! Reach out if you have any questions or suggestions (rshah090@ucr.edu).

Thanks :)
